            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Welcome to GAFTW</h1><p>Ok, so.  Hello - I'm Alex.  Beth's my better half.  We're building a garage in the mountains of Colorado and  We're pretty stoked about it! It's not just that we've run out of space in the new house (we have) and it's not just that it's going to have this crazy awesome apartment on the second story (it will!) it's more like the intersection of a bunch of ideas that we are excited to see come to life.  We'll get to all that soon enough but for now, Welcome! We're glad you found us and hope that our version of this journey will be helpful, interesting or at least entertaining for some of you.</p></article>]]></description>

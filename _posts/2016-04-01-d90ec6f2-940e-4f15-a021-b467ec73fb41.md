We'll talk about design considerations, constraints and challenges. I'm really excited to talk about infill, rental housing, financial considerations and the rewards we expect at the end of all this.  We've got some green goals (both environmental and $$$) to achieve and a pretty good cast of characters to introduce you to along the way.
